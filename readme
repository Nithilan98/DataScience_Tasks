Task 5:
   The data is available as two attached CSV files:

The data has the following two tables:
      1] A user table ( "takehome_users" ) with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the
product in the last two years. This table includes:
   ● name: the user's name
   ● object_id: the user's id
   ● email: email address
   ● creation_source: how their account was created. This takes on one
 of 5 values:
   ○ PERSONAL_PROJECTS: invited to join another user's
      personal workspace
   ○ GUEST_INVITE: invited to an organization as a guest
      (limited permissions)
   ○ ORG_INVITE: invited to an organization (as a full member)
   ○ SIGNUP: signed up via the website
   ○ SIGNUP_GOOGLE_AUTH: signed up using Google
      Authentication (using a Google email account for their login
      id)

   ● creation_time: when they created their account
   ● last_session_creation_time: unix timestamp of last login
   ● opted_in_to_mailing_list: whether they have opted into receiving
      marketing emails
   ● enabled_for_marketing_drip: whether they are on the regular
      marketing email drip
   ● org_id: the organization (group of users) they belong to
   ● invited_by_user_id: which user invited them to join (if applicable).
      2] A usage summary table ( "takehome_user_engagement" ) that has a row for each day
         that a user logged into the product.

Defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into the product on three separate
days in at least one seven­day period , identify which factors predict future user
adoption
